                <h3>Chief Executive Officer</h3>
                <h4>TheDigitalCraftMan <br>
                2023-Present</h4>
                <p>As the Chief Executive Officer of TheDigitalCraftMan, 
                    I have taken a hands-on approach in leading the company's vision and growth.
                    Since its inception in 2023, my primary focus has been on developing and executing innovative strategies 
                    that position the company as a leader in digital solutions. My role involves not only overseeing the development 
                    of high-quality websites and digital marketing campaigns but also ensuring that each project aligns with our clients’ 
                    objectives and the rapidly changing digital landscape.

                    I lead a team of talented professionals, including web developers, designers, and digital marketers, 
                    who share a commitment to delivering exceptional results. By fostering a collaborative and forward-thinking
                    environment, I ensure that our team remains ahead of industry trends and capable of offering cutting-edge solutions.
                    From managing day-to-day operations to steering long-term company objectives, 
                    I am deeply involved in every aspect of the business, from initial client engagement to project delivery.
                    
                    A crucial part of my role is staying attuned to market trends and customer feedback, which allows me to refine our 
                    service offerings continually. This proactive approach has helped TheDigitalCraftMan expand its portfolio and 
                    solidify strong relationships with clients. In addition, I actively seek out partnerships and collaborations with
                    industry leaders, enhancing our capabilities and broadening our reach.
                    
                    I also manage the company’s resources and operations, ensuring that we are efficient and sustainable. 
                    This includes budget oversight and the strategic allocation of resources to maximize growth. 
                    By incorporating the latest technologies and frameworks into our workflow, 
                    I keep TheDigitalCraftMan competitive in an ever-evolving industry.
                    
                    In addition to my business responsibilities, I lead initiatives that give back to the community, 
                    including digital literacy programs aimed at empowering local populations through technology. 
                    These efforts not only reflect our commitment to corporate social responsibility but also align with 
                    my personal passion for technology as a tool for positive change.
                    
                    As CEO, I remain dedicated to scaling TheDigitalCraftMan while maintaining our high standards of 
                    innovation and client satisfaction.</p>

                    <h3>Senior Web Developer</h3>
                    <h4>Youth For Technology Foundation <br>
                    2022-2024</h4>
                    <p>As a Senior Web Developer at the Youth for Technology Foundation from 2022 to 2024,
                     I took on a leadership role in the development and maintenance of innovative web solutions. 
                     I was responsible for designing and coding websites and web applications that were both 
                     user-friendly and responsive, ensuring they performed optimally across all browsers and devices.
                      This required not only technical expertise but also a deep understanding of user experience and 
                      web accessibility principles.

                    One of my key responsibilities was mentoring junior developers. 
                    I provided guidance on coding best practices, debugging, and project management, 
                    helping to foster a collaborative and growth-oriented environment within the team. 
                    By sharing my knowledge and experience, I helped elevate the skill sets of my colleagues 
                    and ensured the consistent delivery of high-quality projects.
                    
                    In addition to development, I worked closely with designers, content creators,
                     and other stakeholders to ensure that the visual elements of each project aligned with 
                     its functional requirements. This collaborative approach allowed us to create cohesive, engaging,
                      and highly functional digital products that met client goals and user needs.
                    
                    I also spearheaded the implementation of new technologies and development frameworks, 
                    ensuring that the team stayed up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
                     This proactive approach not only improved the efficiency of our workflows but also 
                     enhanced the overall quality and security of the web solutions we delivered.
                    
                    During my time at the Youth for Technology Foundation, 
                    I gained valuable experience working on real-world projects, 
                    including ones focused on social impact. These projects involved building and 
                    styling websites that promoted education, digital literacy, and community development, 
                    which further fueled my passion for using technology as a tool for positive change.</p>
